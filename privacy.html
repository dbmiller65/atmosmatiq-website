            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>David Miller ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use the AtmosMatIQ app and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.</p>

            <p>When you use AtmosMatIQ, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> With your permission, we collect your device's location to provide weather information for your current area. You can disable location services for AtmosMatIQ at any time through your device settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Search History:</strong> We temporarily store the cities you search for to improve your experience, but this information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the app, such as which features are most commonly used.</li>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>AtmosMatIQ uses the OpenWeatherMap API to provide weather data. When you search for a city or use location services, we send that location information to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve weather data. Please review OpenWeatherMap's privacy policy at <a href="https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://openweathermap.org/privacy-policy</a> for information on how they handle data.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain location data only for the duration necessary to provide you with weather information. Search history is stored locally on your device and can be cleared by clearing the app's data through your device settings.</p>
